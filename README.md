# ball-collection-machine Repository 

This repository is here to archive the code for a project that can automatically collect balls from , avoid obstacles in, and navigate an environment.

On their own, the code will not run as they were intended to run in two ros 2 Nodes communicating with one another, running within a Raspberry Pi 4 which communicates with two Arduino UNO Boards via Serial.
